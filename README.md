# I-LOVE-ENCODE-TOO
In this article, you'll know why I made the project.
On the evening of one day in 2012, a fully armed special force assembled at the downstairs of a house. They brought door hammers, night vision equipment, and even snipers at the top.
The host of the house, is the designer of VK(the largest Russian social networking site at that time) Pavel Durov.
He felt panic that time, he tried to phone his brother, but as soon as he picked up his phone, he realized that this phone call would be monitored, so he gave up.
Fortunately the force left and Durov got rid of danger.
Then, he designed a program called Telegram.
All the chats in Telegram are decoded, so this social networking site is secure enough.
Isn't it?
The algorithm was designed by Durov, not me myself, for me, it isn't 100% secure.
So I decided to design a decode algorithm by myself.
And that's it.
